Traditional chat apps face a number of issues that are resolved by saké, an anonymous chat app with decentralized payment integration.
## features
> uncork the insecurities
First of all, it offers a decentralized and secure communication platform. Sake keeps the user hidden. The communication and transactions between users are safer as a result of the heightened security.

Second, Sake streamlines user-to-user financial transfers. Without needing to use a different payment software or platform, users of Sake may quickly send money to other users and also to groups of users. Sake can also transfer NFTs and host crowdfunding.
> Toast to transactions
Thirdly, it offers multi-signature features as well, which demand additional permissions for increased protection. Sake is now a secure and practical platform for managing financial transactions for both individuals and companies because of these characteristics. The multi-sig wallet users can also chat within themselves to discuss their payments which increases the clarity of the transactions
